			The universe is so vast that intelligent life must surely have arisen many times. The universe is also so old that even one technological species would have had time to expand and fill the galaxy. Yet there is no sign of life anywhere except on Earth. <span class="human">Humans</span> call this the <span class="fermi">Fermi Paradox</span>.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			One proposed solution to the <span class="fermi">Fermi Paradox</span> is that intelligent species actively try to conceal their presence, to avoid being targeted by hostile invaders.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Speaking as a member of a species that has been driven nearly to extinction by <span class="human">humans</span>, I can attest that this is a wise strategy.
