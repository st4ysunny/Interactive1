			<span class="parrot">Parrots</span> are <span class="learn">vocal learners</span>: we can learn to make new sounds after we’ve heard them. It’s an ability that few animals possess. A dog may understand dozens of commands, but it will never do anything but bark.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<span class="human">Humans</span> are <span class="learn">vocal learners</span>, too. We have that in common. So <span class="human">humans</span> and <span class="parrot">parrots</span> share a special relationship with sound. We don’t simply cry out. We pronounce. We enunciate.
		</p>
		<br>

			Perhaps that’s why <span class="human">humans</span> built <span class="arecibo">Arecibo</span> the way they did. A receiver doesn’t have to be a transmitter, but <span class="arecibo">Arecibo</span> is both. It’s an ear for listening, and a mouth for speaking.
