			<span class="human">Human</span> activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction, but I don’t blame them for it. They didn’t do it maliciously. They just weren’t paying attention. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			And <span class="human">humans</span> create such beautiful myths; what imaginations they have. Perhaps that’s why their aspirations are so immense. Look at <span class="arecibo">Arecibo</span>. Any species who can build such a thing must have greatness within them.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			My species probably won’t be here for much longer; it’s likely that we’ll die before our time and join the <span class="silence">Great Silence</span>. But before we go, we are sending a message to humanity. We just hope the telescope at <span class="areciboe">Arecibo</span> will enable them to hear it.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The message is this:
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<span class="be-good">You be good. I love you.</span>
