			There was an African gray <span class="parrot">parrot</span> named Alex. He was famous for his cognitive abilities. Famous among <span class="human">humans</span>, that is.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			A <span class="human">human</span> researcher named Irene Pepperberg spent thirty years studying Alex. She found that not only did Alex know the words for shapes and colors, he actually understood the concepts of shape and color.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Many scientists were skeptical that a bird could grasp abstract concepts. <span class="human">Humans</span> like to think they’re unique. But eventually Pepperberg convinced them that Alex wasn’t just repeating words, that he understood what he was saying.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Out of all my cousins, Alex was the one who came closest to being taken seriously as a communication partner by <span class="human">humans</span>. Alex died suddenly, when he was still relatively young. The evening before he died, Alex said to Pepperberg, <span class="be-good">“You be good. I love you.”</span>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			If <span class="human">humans</span> are looking for a connection with a nonhuman intelligence, what more can they ask for than that?
